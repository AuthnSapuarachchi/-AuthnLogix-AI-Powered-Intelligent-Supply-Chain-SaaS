================================================================================
KEY TECHNICAL CHALLENGES SOLVED
================================================================================

1. RabbitMQ Container Networking
   - Issue: Backend couldn't connect to RabbitMQ container
   - Solution: Configured container hostname (authnlogix-rabbitmq) instead of localhost
   - Learning: Docker network DNS resolution for inter-container communication

2. JWT Authentication in Filters
   - Issue: JWT filter was throwing exceptions and blocking requests
   - Solution: Added proper exception handling for expired tokens
   - Learning: Filter chain execution order and exception propagation

3. Asynchronous Email Processing
   - Issue: Email sending was blocking shipment creation
   - Solution: Implemented async messaging via RabbitMQ
   - Learning: Event-driven architecture with message brokers

4. Real-Time Inventory Updates
   - Issue: Manual refresh required to see inventory changes
   - Solution: WebSocket integration with STOMP protocol
   - Learning: Broadcasting messages to multiple clients

5. Audit Logging
   - Issue: Need to track all changes to entities
   - Solution: Integrated Hibernate Envers for automatic auditing
   - Learning: JPA interceptors and audit trail patterns
